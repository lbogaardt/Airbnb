Guide to Krommerijn 8, Utrecht
==============

Dear Katrin,

Welcome to Krommerijn 8. I hope you have a nice stay in Utrecht. This guide will give you some additional information about my apartment and the surrounding area. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via Airbnb or via WhatsApp (+31613151353). For emergencies, it may be better to call or WhatsApp my sister Carlijn (+31631144027).

All the best,

Laurens Bogaardt

# Check-In (!)

My sister Carlijn will meet you at my apartment to hand you the keys at 13:00. If you are early or late, please let her know via WhatsApp or by calling (+31631144027) so she doesn’t have to wait for too long.

# Check-Out (!)

You can stay in the apartment until around 18:00 the day of check-out. When you leave, please throw the keys in my mailbox; number 8 on the bottom-left.

# Freezer (!)

You can use the fridge and the freezer during your stay, but please make sure to close the freezer door properly. It needs to be pushed hard or a small gap will remain.

# Toilet (!)

The button of the toilet sometimes gets stuck if you press too hard. When you pull the plastic cover towards you a bit, as in the first photo, the button should release again.

Toilet paper can be found in the closet behind the toilet.

# Coffee and Tea

Feel free to use the Nespresso coffee machine or the kettle to make tea. I will leave milk for the coffee in the fridge. Any other food and drinks in the apartment are my personal items and not intended for guests.

# Cleaning

It’s not necessary to clean my apartment extensively before you leave. I will clean when I get back home. But if you need anything, there is cleaning equipment in the cupboard.

# Trash

Utrecht separates paper and glass from all other trash. Regular trash goes in the left big bin, paper and cardboard goes in the right big bin. Glass goes in the small bin.

# Heating

The heating automatically follows a programme which sets the temperature at 20° between 8:30-10:00 and between 17:00-23:00. It is 17.5° during the other times. If you want to change the temperature, the easiest way is to use the small arrows.

# Washing and Drying

Dryer manual:

Feel free to use the washing machine and the dryer. There is also detergent and an iron. The default programme “Katoen” is usually the best one and takes 1:36 hours to complete.
The default programme of the dryer is usually the best one and takes a maximum of 1:25 hours to complete but shorter if it senses that the clothes are dry.

# Oven and Microwave

Manual:

The oven and microwave are the same machine. The easiest way to start the microwave is simply to press the ‘play’ button.

# Dishwasher

Manual:

There is no need to clean your dishes during your stay. You can simply place them in the sink or inside the dishwasher. I will turn on the dishwasher when I get back home. If you need it, the default programme “P1” is the best option and you can get a dishwasher tablet from the drawer on the right.
